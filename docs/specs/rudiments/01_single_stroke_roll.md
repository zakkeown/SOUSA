## 3. Sticking & Articulation

### Sticking Sequence

<!-- Write the full sticking using R/L with accent markers (>) and ornament prefixes. Use | to separate beats or groups. -->

```
R  L  R  L | R  L  R  L
```

### Stroke Detail Table

<!-- One row per stroke in the cycle. For ornaments, specify the parent stroke. -->

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Ornament Role | Parent Stroke | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | R | tap | none | n/a | Even, unaccented single stroke |
| 2 | L | tap | none | n/a | Even, unaccented single stroke |
| 3 | R | tap | none | n/a | Even, unaccented single stroke |
| 4 | L | tap | none | n/a | Even, unaccented single stroke |
| 5 | R | tap | none | n/a | Even, unaccented single stroke |
| 6 | L | tap | none | n/a | Even, unaccented single stroke |
| 7 | R | tap | none | n/a | Even, unaccented single stroke |
| 8 | L | tap | none | n/a | Even, unaccented single stroke |

### Ornament Timing

No ornaments. All strokes are primary singles.

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

<!-- List the velocity ratio for each stroke type present in this rudiment. Reference _conventions.md for the full scale. -->

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| tap | 0.65 - 0.77 | All strokes at even, matched velocity |

The single stroke roll is fundamentally an exercise in evenness. In its pure form, all strokes are at the same dynamic level with no accents. The velocity ratio listed is relative to accent = 1.0, but since no accents appear in the base rudiment, all strokes share the same absolute velocity target.

### Accent Pattern

<!-- Text visualization showing accent placement across the cycle. Use > for accents, - for unaccented. -->

```
-  -  -  - | -  -  -  -
```

No inherent accent pattern. All strokes are intended to be dynamically equal.

### Dynamic Contour

The single stroke roll has a flat dynamic contour by design. The musical goal is perfect uniformity: identical volume, tone, and spacing for every stroke regardless of hand. In practice, subtle dynamic variations emerge from hand-dominance imbalance and fatigue, which is precisely what this rudiment trains the player to eliminate. When applied musically, accents and dynamic shaping are overlaid onto the pattern (see Variations section), but the rudiment itself is defined as uniform.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

<!-- Height class and motion type for each stroke position. See _conventions.md for definitions. -->

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | tap | half | wrist |
| 2 | L | tap | half | wrist |
| 3 | R | tap | half | wrist |
| 4 | L | tap | half | wrist |
| 5 | R | tap | half | wrist |
| 6 | L | tap | half | wrist |
| 7 | R | tap | half | wrist |
| 8 | L | tap | half | wrist |

At moderate tempos, all strokes are played from the same stick height with matched wrist motion. The height class shifts based on dynamic context (half for mezzo-forte practice, low for quiet, full for loud).

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

<!-- Describe how technique changes across the tempo range. Include specific thresholds where applicable. -->

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | Full wrist strokes with deliberate, controlled motion. Focus on stick height matching between hands. Each stroke is a discrete arm/wrist motion with clear lift and drop. |
| Moderate (100-160 BPM) | Primarily wrist-driven strokes. Rebound becomes more important; the player begins to "catch" the stick bounce rather than lifting fully between strokes. Stick height naturally decreases. |
| Fast (160-220 BPM) | Transition to finger control with minimal wrist involvement. Stick height drops to low/tap class. Moeller technique (whip motion) may be employed for endurance. The fulcrum loosens to allow faster rebound cycling. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Accented singles**: Accent every 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, or 8th note to build dynamic independence while maintaining hand alternation
- **Open-close-open**: Begin slowly, gradually accelerate to maximum speed, then decelerate back — the traditional "rudimental roll" practice
- **Dynamic contour**: Play crescendo and decrescendo across a set number of beats while keeping even spacing
- **Cross-surface orchestration**: Move between drums/surfaces while maintaining alternation (drum set application)
- **Metric modulation**: Play singles in eighth notes, triplets, sixteenths, sextuplets, and 32nd notes to practice subdivision shifts

### Prerequisites

- None. This is the first rudiment and requires no prior rudiment knowledge. Basic grip technique (matched or traditional) is the only prerequisite.

### Builds Toward

- #2 Single Stroke Four (adds grouping and accent)
- #3 Single Stroke Seven (adds grouping, accent, and odd-number phrasing)
- #5 Triple Stroke Roll (same alternation principle extended to three per hand)
- #6 Double Stroke Open Roll (doubles instead of singles)
- All 40 rudiments ultimately build on the ability to alternate single strokes cleanly

### Teaching Notes

The single stroke roll is the very first rudiment taught to beginning percussionists. Despite its apparent simplicity, it remains one of the most difficult to truly master.

**Common mistakes:**
- Uneven spacing between right and left strokes (galloping)
- Volume imbalance between dominant and non-dominant hand
- Stick height mismatch — one hand consistently higher than the other
- Tension in the grip, forearms, or shoulders, especially at faster tempos
- Rushing or dragging relative to the metronome

**Practice strategies:**
- Begin at very slow tempos (60 BPM sixteenths) with a metronome, focusing on stick height matching
- Practice leading with both hands (R-L and L-R) for equal development
- Use a mirror or video to visually compare hand motions
- Practice on a pad, snare drum, and pillow/soft surface to develop different aspects of control
- Record and listen back to check for evenness defects the ear misses in real time

**What to listen for:**
- Identical tone quality from both hands
- Perfectly even spacing (no flamming, no galloping)
- Consistent volume across all strokes
- Clean, focused sound with no buzzing or double-bouncing

### Historical Context

The single stroke roll is the most fundamental action in percussion: one hand, then the other, alternating. While the concept predates any formal codification, the single stroke roll was included in the NARD (National Association of Rudimental Drummers) original 26 rudiments when NARD was founded in 1933. Notably, it was the sole addition to Gardiner Strube's 25 Lessons from his 1870 *Drum and Fife Instructor*; all other 25 NARD rudiments came directly from Strube's work. The single stroke roll was retained as PAS #1 when the Percussive Arts Society expanded the list to 40 in 1984 under Jay Wanamaker's committee. It is universally recognized as the foundation of all drumming technique across every percussion tradition worldwide.
