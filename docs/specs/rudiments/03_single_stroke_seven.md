## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | sixteenth |
| **Cycle Length** | 2 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | 7 |
| **Primary Strokes Per Cycle** | 7 |

Seven sixteenth notes occupy positions 1 through 1 + 1/2 (seven of the eight available sixteenth-note slots in a two-beat span). The eighth slot (position 1 + 3/4) is a sixteenth rest, completing the two-beat cycle. Because the stroke count is odd, the starting hand alternates naturally between cycles.

### Stroke Grid

<!-- Each stroke's position as a beat fraction. Position 0 = downbeat of the cycle. -->

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | A |
| 2 | 1/4 | 1e | L | t |
| 3 | 1/2 | 1& | R | t |
| 4 | 3/4 | 1a | L | t |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | R | t |
| 6 | 1 + 1/4 | 2e | L | t |
| 7 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | R | A |
| — | 1 + 3/4 | 2a | — | (rest) |

The sixteenth rest on slot 2a creates a brief silence that defines the group boundary and provides a rhythmic "breath" before the next cycle. The accent on stroke 7 resolves the phrase and signals the approaching rest.

## 3. Sticking & Articulation

### Sticking Sequence

<!-- Write the full sticking using R/L with accent markers (>) and ornament prefixes. Use | to separate beats or groups. -->

```
>                    >
R  L  R  L | R  L  R  (rest) | L  R  L  R | L  R  L  (rest)
```

Two consecutive cycles shown. Accents (>) fall on strokes 1 and 7 of each group. The lead hand alternates between cycles due to the odd stroke count.

### Stroke Detail Table

<!-- One row per stroke in the cycle. For ornaments, specify the parent stroke. -->

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Ornament Role | Parent Stroke | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | R | accent | none | n/a | Accented downbeat of the group; initiates the phrase |
| 2 | L | tap | none | n/a | Unaccented single stroke |
| 3 | R | tap | none | n/a | Unaccented single stroke |
| 4 | L | tap | none | n/a | Unaccented single stroke |
| 5 | R | tap | none | n/a | Unaccented single stroke |
| 6 | L | tap | none | n/a | Unaccented single stroke |
| 7 | R | accent | none | n/a | Accented final stroke; resolves the phrase before the rest |

### Ornament Timing

No ornaments. All strokes are primary singles.

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

<!-- List the velocity ratio for each stroke type present in this rudiment. Reference _conventions.md for the full scale. -->

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| accent | 1.0 | Reference level; strokes 1 and 7 |
| tap | 0.65 - 0.77 | Strokes 2 through 6; even and matched |

### Accent Pattern

<!-- Text visualization showing accent placement across the cycle. Use > for accents, - for unaccented. -->

```
>  -  -  - | -  -  >  (rest)
```

Accents on strokes 1 and 7 frame the seven-note group. Stroke 1 initiates the phrase, and stroke 7 provides a strong resolution before the rest.

### Dynamic Contour

The single stroke seven has a "bookend" accent contour: strong on the first and last strokes, with five even taps in between. This creates a phrase with clear entry and exit points. The five interior taps should be at a matched, lower dynamic level with no crescendo or decrescendo between them. The accent on stroke 7 is particularly important because it marks the end of the group before the rest, giving the pattern its distinctive rhythmic signature — a burst of activity that resolves firmly before a brief silence. The accent on stroke 1 re-initiates after the rest, creating a clear sense of rhythmic cycling.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

<!-- Height class and motion type for each stroke position. See _conventions.md for definitions. -->

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | accent | full | wrist + arm |
| 2 | L | tap | low | wrist |
| 3 | R | tap | low | wrist |
| 4 | L | tap | low | wrist |
| 5 | R | tap | low | wrist |
| 6 | L | tap | low | wrist |
| 7 | R | accent | full | wrist + arm |

Stroke 1 is a downstroke: starts high, stops low after striking. Strokes 2 through 5 are taps at low height. Stroke 6 is an upstroke: starts low and lifts to full height to prepare the accent on stroke 7. Stroke 7 is a downstroke that resolves the phrase. During the rest, the opposite hand lifts to full height in preparation for the next cycle's opening accent.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

<!-- Describe how technique changes across the tempo range. Include specific thresholds where applicable. -->

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | Full arm + wrist motion for accents with clear height differential. Taps played with deliberate low strokes. The rest provides ample time to prepare the hand switch for the next cycle. Each stroke is distinct and controlled. |
| Moderate (100-160 BPM) | Accent motion becomes more wrist-driven. Taps rely on controlled rebound at low stick height. The rest shrinks in perceived duration; preparation for the next cycle's accent must be efficient. The seven-note phrase begins to feel like a continuous gesture punctuated by a brief gap. |
| Fast (160-200 BPM) | Height differential decreases but accent remains perceptible. Finger control supplements wrist for interior taps. The rest becomes very brief (a single sixteenth note at fast tempo). Moeller technique helps sustain accents without tension. The upstroke into stroke 7's accent and the hand-switch during the rest become the primary technical challenges. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Accent on stroke 1 only**: Remove the accent on stroke 7, treating it as a tap — this creates a single-accent phrase with the rest providing the only grouping cue
- **No accents (even)**: Play all seven strokes at matched dynamics, using only the rest to define the group boundary — useful as an evenness exercise
- **Triplet subdivision**: Notate the seven strokes as a sextuplet (six notes over one beat) plus a quarter note on beat 2, creating a compound rhythmic feel rather than straight sixteenths
- **Open-close-open**: Begin slowly, accelerate through the pattern, then decelerate — applied to sets of seven rather than continuous alternation
- **Accent displacement**: Move accents to different positions within the seven-note group to develop independence
- **Cross-surface orchestration**: Play accents on one surface and taps on another, or distribute the seven strokes across multiple drums

### Prerequisites

- #1 Single Stroke Roll — even alternating strokes at a range of tempos
- #2 Single Stroke Four — ability to accent within an alternating pattern

### Builds Toward

- #16 Single Paradiddle (combines accented grouping with diddle)
- Odd-meter phrasing skills (7/8, 7/16 time signatures)
- Fill and solo vocabulary using seven-note groupings over common time

### Teaching Notes

The single stroke seven introduces two concepts beyond the single stroke four: odd-number grouping and the incorporation of a rest within the rhythmic cycle. The odd count means the starting hand alternates naturally, which is a valuable pedagogical feature — it forces equal development of both hands as lead.

**Common mistakes:**
- Rushing through the seven strokes to "get to the rest" (the rest should arrive naturally, not be forced)
- Uneven spacing of the seven strokes, particularly around strokes 5-6-7 where the player anticipates the accent on 7
- Accent on stroke 7 arrives early (pulled toward the rest) or is weakened
- Failing to maintain the rest — filling the silence with an extra stroke or starting the next cycle too early
- Inconsistent hand alternation across cycles (forgetting that the lead hand switches)

**Practice strategies:**
- Begin by counting aloud: "1-e-&-a, 2-e-&-(rest)" while playing to internalize the rhythmic structure
- Practice with a metronome, placing clicks on beats 1 and 2 to verify the seven strokes and rest align correctly
- Isolate the hand switch: practice the transition from stroke 7 through the rest to stroke 1 of the next cycle at slow tempos
- Practice leading with both R and L as starting hands
- Chain multiple cycles together to build endurance and verify that the hand alternation stays consistent across many repetitions

**What to listen for:**
- Clear accent/tap contrast on strokes 1 and 7
- Five interior taps (strokes 2-6) at identical dynamic level
- Even sixteenth-note spacing across all seven strokes
- A clean, silent rest with no ghost notes or stick noise
- Seamless hand alternation between cycles

### Historical Context

The single stroke seven was not part of the NARD original 26 rudiments. It was added to the PAS 40 International Drum Rudiments list in 1984 as part of the expansion led by Jay Wanamaker's committee. Its inclusion recognized the importance of odd-number groupings in percussion pedagogy. While seven-note single stroke phrases appear throughout historical drumming literature and in various cultural drumming traditions (particularly those with asymmetric meter), the formal codification as PAS #3 established it as a standard exercise alongside the single stroke roll and single stroke four. The single stroke seven completes the single stroke family: continuous (roll), four-note grouping, and seven-note grouping, providing a progressive sequence for developing alternating stroke technique with increasingly complex phrasing.
