## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | eighth (primary strokes); bounces fill the subdivision space between primaries |
| **Cycle Length** | 2 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | Indeterminate (4 primary strokes + 3-8 bounces per primary) |
| **Primary Strokes Per Cycle** | 4 |

The multiple bounce roll is the only rudiment where the exact stroke count per cycle is indeterminate. Each primary stroke initiates 3 to 8 bounces depending on tempo, dynamic level, head tension, and player technique. The goal is a smooth, sustained sound rather than a counted number of strokes.

### Stroke Grid

The stroke grid below represents the 4 primary (initiating) strokes only. Bounces are not placed on fixed grid positions; they fill the time between primaries as a continuous, decaying series.

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | b |
| 2 | 1/2 | 1& | L | b |
| 3 | 1 | 2 | R | b |
| 4 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | L | b |

Each primary stroke at its grid position initiates a buzz: the stick is pressed into the head and allowed to bounce multiple times, with the bounces filling the duration until the next primary on the opposite hand.

## 3. Sticking & Articulation

### Sticking Sequence

```
R(buzz)  L(buzz) | R(buzz)  L(buzz)
```

### Stroke Detail Table

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Ornament Role | Parent Stroke | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | R | buzz | primary | n/a | Initiating press stroke; 3-8 bounces follow |
| 2 | L | buzz | primary | n/a | Initiating press stroke; 3-8 bounces follow |
| 3 | R | buzz | primary | n/a | Initiating press stroke; 3-8 bounces follow |
| 4 | L | buzz | primary | n/a | Initiating press stroke; 3-8 bounces follow |

Each primary stroke is both the initiator and the sustainer of its buzz. There is no separation between the primary and its bounces; they form a single continuous gesture.

### Ornament Timing

**Buzz Bounce Behavior:**
- Each primary stroke produces a non-fixed number of bounces (typically 3-8)
- Bounces are not rhythmically quantized; they are a continuous decay of stick energy against the head
- The bounce rate is determined by: fulcrum pressure, stick weight, head tension, dynamic level, and tempo
- At slower tempos, more bounces occur per primary (the time gap between primaries is longer)
- At faster tempos, fewer bounces occur per primary (less time to fill)
- The transition between one hand's buzz and the other must be seamless with no audible gap or accent

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| buzz primary | 0.65 - 0.77 | The initiating stroke that starts each buzz; unaccented in the base rudiment |
| buzz bounce (1st) | 0.60 - 0.80 x primary | First bounce after primary contact |
| buzz bounce (2nd) | 0.50 - 0.70 x primary | Progressive decay |
| buzz bounce (nth) | further decaying | Each successive bounce is quieter than the last |

The velocity ratios for bounces are expressed as multipliers of the primary stroke velocity, not of accent = 1.0. Since the base rudiment has no accents, the primary strokes sit in the tap velocity range (0.65 - 0.77). Each bounce decays further from there.

### Accent Pattern

```
-  - | -  -
```

No inherent accent pattern. The multiple bounce roll in its pure form is a sustained, even sound. The primary strokes should be as inaudible as possible within the texture; the goal is to eliminate any pulsation from the hand alternation.

### Dynamic Contour

The multiple bounce roll has a flat dynamic contour by design. The musical goal is a single sustained tone, analogous to a bowed string instrument or a wind instrument holding a note. Any audible pulsation (hearing individual primaries) is considered a technical deficiency. The roll may be performed at any dynamic level from pianissimo to fortissimo, but within a given passage the dynamic should remain constant unless a crescendo or decrescendo is indicated. Dynamic shaping (crescendo rolls, decrescendo rolls) is a common musical application but is not part of the rudiment's base definition.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | buzz | low | rebound |
| 2 | L | buzz | low | rebound |
| 3 | R | buzz | low | rebound |
| 4 | L | buzz | low | rebound |

The buzz stroke is physically distinct from all other stroke types. The stick is not lifted and dropped in a discrete motion; instead, the player presses the stick into the head with controlled fulcrum pressure and allows the natural rebound of the stick against the head to produce multiple bounces. The height class is low because the stick remains close to the head throughout the gesture.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-90 BPM) | Each primary has maximum time to buzz (6-8 bounces typical). The player must sustain fulcrum pressure longer. Hand transitions are more exposed and must be carefully overlapped to avoid gaps. The subdivisions of the primaries are typically eighth notes. Roll quality is hardest here because gaps between hand changes are most audible. |
| Moderate (90-120 BPM) | The standard concert/orchestral roll tempo range. Primaries typically on eighth-note spacing yield 4-6 bounces each. The overlap between hands is natural and the roll sounds most sustained. Slight fulcrum pressure adjustments control the density. |
| Fast (120-140 BPM) | Fewer bounces per primary (3-4). The roll begins to approximate a double stroke roll in feel. The player relies more on stick speed and less on sustained pressure. At the upper extreme, the distinction between a fast buzz roll and a closed double stroke roll becomes subtle. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Metered buzz roll**: Primary strokes placed on specific subdivisions (eighth notes, triplets, or sixteenth notes) to create different roll densities. Eighth-note primaries are the most common in orchestral playing; sixteenth-note primaries produce a denser roll.
- **Orchestral roll (concert roll)**: The standard application in concert percussion. Seamless, gap-free sustained sound. Often performed with crescendo/decrescendo shaping.
- **Rudimental buzz roll**: In field/marching drumming, the buzz roll is sometimes performed with more defined primary pulsation and at louder dynamics, contrasting with the smooth orchestral style.
- **Tied buzz roll**: Rolls that begin on one beat and sustain through to a release point, notated with ties. The player must manage the entry, sustain, and release.
- **Dynamic-shaped rolls**: Crescendo rolls (pp to ff) and decrescendo rolls (ff to pp) are fundamental orchestral techniques built on the buzz roll.

### Prerequisites

- #1 Single Stroke Roll (alternating hand control is the foundation)
- Basic rebound control: the player must be able to produce controlled multiple bounces from a single stroke before combining them into a roll

### Builds Toward

- #7-#15 Counted Stroke Rolls (the buzz roll concept applied with specific stroke counts using double strokes)
- Orchestral roll technique (the primary application of this rudiment)
- Concert snare drum literature (virtually all orchestral snare parts require buzz roll mastery)

### Teaching Notes

The multiple bounce roll is one of the most difficult rudiments to master despite its conceptual simplicity. It requires a fundamentally different physical approach from all other rudiments.

**Common mistakes:**
- Pressing too hard into the head, which chokes the bounce and produces a "crunch" instead of a smooth buzz
- Pressing too lightly, which produces an uncontrolled, uneven bounce with audible gaps
- Audible hand-change pulsation (hearing the R-L alternation as a rhythmic pattern rather than a sustained tone)
- Uneven buzz density between dominant and non-dominant hands
- Using wrist motion instead of fulcrum pressure (treating it like a fast single stroke roll rather than a true press roll)
- Starting or ending the roll abruptly instead of with a clean attack and release

**Practice strategies:**
- Begin by practicing single-hand buzzes: press one stick into the head and sustain a controlled buzz for 2-4 seconds, then switch hands
- Practice slow hand-to-hand transitions: R(buzz)...L(buzz)...R(buzz), focusing on seamless overlap
- Use a practice pad only for basic coordination; true buzz roll development requires a drum head (practice pads often have too much or too little rebound)
- Practice at pianissimo first, as quiet buzzes require the most refined pressure control
- Record and listen back to check for pulsation, gaps, and unevenness

**What to listen for:**
- A smooth, sustained, continuous tone with no gaps or pulsation
- Identical buzz quality from both hands
- Clean, defined attack at the beginning and release at the end
- Even density throughout the duration of the roll
- No "crunching" or "choking" sounds from excess pressure

### Historical Context

The multiple bounce roll is one of the oldest and most fundamental drumming techniques, with roots in European military drumming dating back centuries. In the NARD original 26 rudiments (1933), it appeared as the "Long Roll" in its closed (buzz) form, descending directly from Gardiner Strube's 1870 *Drum and Fife Instructor*. The technique originated in the field drumming tradition where sustained rolls were necessary to signal troops over long distances and across noisy battlefields. In the PAS 1984 expansion to 40 rudiments, it was given the more descriptive name "Multiple Bounce Roll" (PAS #4) to distinguish it clearly from the open (double stroke) roll and the counted rolls. Today, it is the standard roll technique in orchestral and concert band percussion, while the open double stroke roll is preferred in rudimental and marching contexts.

## 7. Notation

### Stick Notation

```
R(bz)  L(bz)  R(bz)  L(bz)
```

The "bz" indicates a buzz/press stroke. In standard percussion notation, each note stem carries a "Z" through it or three slashes (tremolo marking) to indicate the buzz.

### Grid Visualization

```
Beat:    | 1           &         | 2           &         |
Hand:    | R           L         | R           L         |
Type:    | b           b         | b           b         |
Accent:  |                       |                       |
Buzz:    | ~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~| ~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~|
```

The `~~~` represents the continuous buzz sound. The `^` marks the hand transition point where one hand's buzz ends and the other begins. In a well-executed roll, the transition is inaudible.
