## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | sextuplet |
| **Cycle Length** | 2 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | 12 |
| **Primary Strokes Per Cycle** | 12 |

The triple stroke roll divides each beat into six equal parts (sextuplets). Each hand plays three consecutive strokes occupying one beat, then the other hand plays three strokes on the next beat. One full cycle of RRR LLL RRR LLL spans 2 beats and contains 12 strokes.

### Stroke Grid

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | A |
| 2 | 1/6 | 1la | R | t |
| 3 | 1/3 | 1li | R | t |
| 4 | 1/2 | 1& | L | A |
| 5 | 2/3 | 1la | L | t |
| 6 | 5/6 | 1li | L | t |
| 7 | 1 | 2 | R | A |
| 8 | 1 + 1/6 | 2la | R | t |
| 9 | 1 + 1/3 | 2li | R | t |
| 10 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | L | A |
| 11 | 1 + 2/3 | 2la | L | t |
| 12 | 1 + 5/6 | 2li | L | t |

Each group of three strokes (e.g., strokes 1-3) occupies exactly one half-beat. The first stroke of each group lands on the strong sextuplet position (beat or "&") and carries a natural accent from the wrist initiation.

| 2 | R | tap | none | n/a | Finger-controlled second stroke |
| 3 | R | tap | none | n/a | Finger-controlled third stroke; weakest of the group |
| 4 | L | accent | none | n/a | Wrist-initiated first stroke of left-hand group |
| 5 | L | tap | none | n/a | Finger-controlled second stroke |
| 6 | L | tap | none | n/a | Finger-controlled third stroke; weakest of the group |
| 7 | R | accent | none | n/a | Wrist-initiated first stroke of right-hand group |
| 8 | R | tap | none | n/a | Finger-controlled second stroke |
| 9 | R | tap | none | n/a | Finger-controlled third stroke; weakest of the group |

### Ornament Timing

No ornaments. All 12 strokes are primary strokes. Each group of three same-hand strokes is evenly spaced within the sextuplet grid at intervals of 1/6 beat.

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| accent (stroke 1 of each group) | 1.0 | Wrist-initiated first stroke; full energy |
| tap (stroke 2 of each group) | ~0.95 x stroke 1 | Slight decay; finger-controlled bounce |
| tap (stroke 3 of each group) | ~0.90 x stroke 1 | Further decay; weakest finger bounce |

The velocity decay within each three-stroke group is a natural consequence of the technique: the wrist initiates the first stroke with full energy, and the second and third strokes are produced by progressively weaker finger rebounds. The 1.0 / 0.95 / 0.90 decay profile reflects this physical reality. In an ideal performance, the player minimizes this decay to produce an even roll, but the inherent decay is always present to some degree.

### Accent Pattern

```
>     -     -     >     -     - | >     -     -     >     -     -
```

The first stroke of each three-stroke group carries a natural accent from the wrist initiation. In the base rudiment, the player aims to minimize this accent for evenness, but the accent pattern is inherent to the technique.

### Dynamic Contour

The triple stroke roll has a repeating micro-contour within each three-stroke group: a slight emphasis on stroke 1 followed by a gentle decay through strokes 2 and 3. This creates a subtle pulse at the half-beat level (two pulses per beat). The musical goal is to minimize this pulse as much as possible, producing an even stream of sextuplets. When the rudiment is applied musically, the natural accent pattern can be embraced or deliberately overridden with accent schemes. The overall dynamic contour across the full cycle is flat; the micro-contour is the distinguishing characteristic.

### Stroke Map

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | accent | half | wrist |
| 2 | R | tap | low | fingers |
| 3 | R | tap | low | fingers |
| 4 | L | accent | half | wrist |
| 5 | L | tap | low | fingers |
| 6 | L | tap | low | fingers |
| 7 | R | accent | half | wrist |
| 8 | R | tap | low | fingers |
| 9 | R | tap | low | fingers |
| 10 | L | accent | half | wrist |
| 11 | L | tap | low | fingers |
| 12 | L | tap | low | fingers |

The triple stroke roll uses a "throw-dribble-dribble" motion (described by Bill Bachman as "alley-oop-oop"). The wrist throws the stick down for stroke 1, and the fingers control the rebound for strokes 2 and 3. After stroke 3, the hand relaxes and the stick rebounds to the starting position, ready for the next group. This is fundamentally different from a buzz roll (where bounces are uncontrolled) and from playing three individual wrist strokes (which is too slow at performance tempos).

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | All three strokes can be played as individual free strokes using the wrist. The sextuplet spacing is wide enough that each stroke is a discrete, controlled motion. This is the range for learning the rudiment. Finger control is less critical; the player focuses on even spacing and volume matching. |
| Moderate (100-140 BPM) | Transition to wrist-finger combination. Stroke 1 is wrist-driven; strokes 2 and 3 are increasingly finger-controlled. The "throw-dribble-dribble" motion becomes essential. French grip (thumb on top) may be adopted for better finger access. Stick height drops for strokes 2 and 3. |
| Fast (140-160 BPM) | Almost entirely finger-driven for strokes 2 and 3. The wrist motion for stroke 1 becomes minimal. The feel approaches a controlled triple bounce. At the upper extreme, the triple stroke roll begins to resemble a buzz roll with exactly three bounces per primary. The fulcrum must be loose enough to allow rapid rebound. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Unaccented triple stroke roll**: All 12 strokes at uniform dynamic level; eliminates the natural group-initial accent for a smoother roll effect
- **Accented triple stroke roll**: Deliberate accent on the first stroke of each group to emphasize the rhythmic grouping
- **Triple stroke roll with accents on other positions**: Accent on stroke 2 or stroke 3 for independence exercises
- **Open-close-open**: Gradually accelerate from slow (discrete wrist strokes) to fast (finger-controlled bounces) and back, developing the technique transition
- **Metric modulation**: Playing triple strokes within eighth-note triplet, sixteenth-note triplet, or sextuplet frameworks to explore different tempos and musical contexts
- **Cross-surface orchestration**: Moving between drums/surfaces while maintaining the three-per-hand grouping (drum set application)

### Prerequisites

- #1 Single Stroke Roll (hand alternation is the foundation)
- #6 Double Stroke Open Roll (two-per-hand control must be mastered before extending to three)
- Basic finger control technique (the ability to produce controlled rebounds with the fingers)

### Builds Toward

- #4 Multiple Bounce Roll (the triple stroke roll at extreme speed approaches a buzz roll; mastering controlled triples builds toward controlled multi-bounce technique)
- Advanced multi-bounce control and open/close roll transitions
- Drum set applications: fast fill patterns, Tom-tom rolls using groups of three

### Teaching Notes

The triple stroke roll is a critical bridge between the double stroke roll and the multiple bounce roll. It develops the finger control necessary for all advanced rebound-based techniques.

**Common mistakes:**
- Playing all three strokes with the wrist (too slow, too tiring, and prevents development at higher tempos)
- Allowing the third stroke to become inaudibly weak or disappear entirely
- Uneven spacing within the three-stroke group (typically a gap between stroke 1 and stroke 2, with strokes 2 and 3 too close together)
- Gripping too tightly, which prevents the stick from rebounding naturally for strokes 2 and 3
- Uneven groups between dominant and non-dominant hands (the non-dominant hand's third stroke is typically the weakest point)
- Rushing the hand change (cutting stroke 3 short to get to the next group)

**Practice strategies:**
- Begin with slow, individual wrist strokes (RRR LLL at 60 BPM sextuplets) to establish the spacing
- Gradually introduce finger control for strokes 2 and 3 as tempo increases
- Practice single-hand groups (RRR stop, RRR stop) before combining hands
- Use a mirror or video to compare stick heights between strokes 1, 2, and 3
- Practice on different surfaces: snare drum (high rebound), floor tom (medium rebound), and practice pad (variable rebound) to develop adaptability
- Experiment with French grip for better finger access
- Record and listen back, specifically checking that stroke 3 is clearly audible and evenly spaced

**What to listen for:**
- Even spacing between all three strokes within each group (no galloping)
- Stroke 3 is clearly audible and not significantly weaker than strokes 1 and 2
- Smooth hand transitions (no gap or flamming at the changeover)
- Identical quality between right-hand and left-hand groups
- Consistent sextuplet rhythm across the full cycle

### Historical Context

The triple stroke roll was not part of the NARD original 26 rudiments (1933). It was one of the 14 rudiments added when the Percussive Arts Society expanded the list to 40 in 1984, under the committee led by Jay Wanamaker. The triple stroke roll was included to address a gap in the original list: while the single stroke roll (#1) and the double stroke roll (#6) covered one and two strokes per hand respectively, there was no rudiment codifying the three-per-hand technique that many drummers already practiced informally. The addition formalized the finger control technique that is essential for advanced rudimental and orchestral playing. Bill Bachman, in his *Modern Drummer* series on the top 10 rudiments, ranks the triple stroke roll as one of the most important rudiments for developing finger technique, noting that mastering controlled triples is the gateway to all multi-bounce techniques.
