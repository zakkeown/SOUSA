## 3. Sticking & Articulation

### Sticking Sequence

<!-- Write the full sticking using R/L with accent markers (>) and ornament prefixes. Use | to separate beats or groups. -->

```
R R  L L | R R  L L
```

### Stroke Detail Table

<!-- One row per stroke in the cycle. For ornaments, specify the parent stroke. -->

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Ornament Role | Parent Stroke | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle, wrist-initiated |
| 2 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle, finger-controlled |
| 3 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle, wrist-initiated |
| 4 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle, finger-controlled |
| 5 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle, wrist-initiated |
| 6 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle, finger-controlled |
| 7 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle, wrist-initiated |
| 8 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle, finger-controlled |

### Ornament Timing

**Diddle Timing**:
- Each diddle pair occupies one eighth-note duration (1/2 beat)
- Each individual diddle stroke occupies 1/4 beat (one sixteenth note)
- d1 falls on the grid position (downbeat or "&")
- d2 falls on the following sixteenth subdivision ("e" or "a")
- At slow tempos: both strokes are distinct and clearly separated (open)
- At fast tempos: strokes are closely spaced, nearly indistinguishable (closed)

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

<!-- List the velocity ratio for each stroke type present in this rudiment. Reference _conventions.md for the full scale. -->

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| d1 | 0.65 - 0.77 | Matches the passage dynamic (tap-level in the base rudiment; matches accent level when played in accented context) |
| d2 | 0.90 - 0.98 x d1 | Slight natural decay on the second bounce |

The double stroke open roll is fundamentally an exercise in evenness between d1 and d2. In its pure form, all strokes are at the same dynamic level with no accents. The d1 velocity ratio listed is relative to accent = 1.0 at tap level; since no accents appear in the base rudiment, all d1 strokes share the same absolute velocity target. The d2 velocity decays slightly from d1 because the second stroke is generated by finger rebound rather than a full wrist throw, resulting in marginally less energy. The hallmark of mastery is minimizing the gap between d1 and d2 (pushing the ratio toward 0.98 or even 1.0).

### Accent Pattern

<!-- Text visualization showing accent placement across the cycle. Use > for accents, - for unaccented. -->

```
-  -  -  - | -  -  -  -
```

No inherent accent pattern. All strokes are intended to be dynamically equal.

### Dynamic Contour

The double stroke open roll has a flat dynamic contour by design, identical to the single stroke roll in intent. The musical goal is perfect uniformity: identical volume, tone, and spacing for every stroke regardless of hand or diddle position. In practice, the primary challenge is matching d2 to d1 within each diddle pair. Subtle dynamic variations emerge from: (1) the natural decay of d2 relative to d1, (2) hand-dominance imbalance between R and L diddles, and (3) fatigue at faster tempos. Training this rudiment develops the finger control and rebound sensitivity needed to eliminate these inequalities. When applied musically, accents, crescendos, and dynamic shaping may be overlaid (see Variations section), but the rudiment itself is defined as uniform.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

<!-- Height class and motion type for each stroke position. See _conventions.md for definitions. -->

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 2 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 3 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 4 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 5 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 6 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 7 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 8 | L | d2 | low | fingers |

The d1 stroke is initiated by the wrist from half height, throwing the stick downward. The d2 stroke is generated by finger control catching the rebound from d1 and directing it back into the head at a lower stick height. The hand then relaxes to allow the stick to return to the starting position, preparing for the next hand's d1.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

<!-- Describe how technique changes across the tempo range. Include specific thresholds where applicable. -->

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | **Open doubles.** Each diddle consists of two distinct, individually controlled wrist strokes. Both d1 and d2 are played with full wrist motion at similar stick heights. The strokes are clearly audible as two separate notes. This is the "open" quality that gives the rudiment its name. Focus is on matching d1 and d2 volume precisely. |
| Moderate (100-140 BPM) | **Transition zone.** d1 is played with the wrist, d2 with the fingers catching and directing the rebound. This is the "alley-oop" technique: wrist drops the stick (d1), fingers close to snap the second stroke (d2). The stick height for d2 drops below d1. Players must develop the relaxed grip that allows the stick to bounce freely between the two strokes. |
| Fast (140-200 BPM) | **Closed doubles.** Forearms pump with minimal wrist involvement. The first two fingers (index and middle) generate d2 almost entirely from rebound control. Stick heights are low to tap class for both strokes. The two strokes within each diddle become nearly indistinguishable to the ear — this is the "closed" roll sound used in rudimental and marching percussion. The fulcrum loosens to maximize rebound energy. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Accented doubles**: Accent the d1 of each diddle (>RR >LL) to build dynamic independence within the diddle pair
- **Open-close-open**: Begin slowly with clearly separated strokes, gradually accelerate to maximum speed (closed), then decelerate — the traditional long roll practice
- **Dynamic contour**: Play crescendo and decrescendo across a set number of beats while maintaining even diddle quality
- **Inverted doubles**: Lead with the non-dominant hand (LL RR LL RR) for equal development
- **Metric modulation**: Play diddles in eighth notes, sixteenths, and 32nd notes to practice subdivision shifts
- **Accent patterns**: Overlay accent groupings (every 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th stroke, etc.) to develop independence between accent placement and double-stroke mechanics

### Prerequisites

- #1 Single Stroke Roll — clean alternation and hand balance must be established before adding the second stroke per hand

### Builds Toward

- #7 Five Stroke Roll (2 diddles + 1 accent = defined start/stop excerpt)
- #8 Six Stroke Roll (3 diddles with accents)
- #9 Seven Stroke Roll (3 diddles + 1 accent)
- #10 Nine Stroke Roll (4 diddles + 1 accent)
- #11 Ten Stroke Roll (4 diddles + 2 accents)
- #12 Eleven Stroke Roll (5 diddles + 1 accent)
- #13 Thirteen Stroke Roll (6 diddles + 1 accent)
- #14 Fifteen Stroke Roll (7 diddles + 1 accent)
- #15 Seventeen Stroke Roll (8 diddles + 1 accent)
- #16 Single Paradiddle (combines singles with one diddle)
- #17 Double Paradiddle (extends the paradiddle pattern)
- #18 Triple Paradiddle (further extends the paradiddle pattern)
- #19 Paradiddle-Diddle (paradiddle + additional diddle)
- All rudiments containing double strokes (drags, dragadiddles, flam paradiddle-diddles, etc.)

### Teaching Notes

The double stroke open roll is one of the most important rudiments in all of percussion. It is the foundational double-stroke pattern from which all counted rolls, paradiddles, and diddle-based rudiments derive. Mastering it separates competent drummers from great ones.

**Common mistakes:**
- Playing d2 significantly softer than d1 (the "limp second stroke")
- Using two separate wrist strokes at tempos where the wrist-finger technique should take over
- Bouncing the stick uncontrollably rather than directing the rebound with the fingers
- Gripping too tightly, which kills the rebound needed for d2
- Uneven spacing between d1 and d2 (rushing the second stroke) or between diddle pairs
- Neglecting the non-dominant hand — the weaker hand's doubles often lag behind

**Practice strategies:**
- Begin at very slow tempos (60 BPM sixteenths) with a metronome, playing two deliberate wrist strokes per hand
- Focus on matching stick heights: d2 should come up to the same height as d1 after the stroke
- Practice the "open-close-open" long roll to build the full tempo spectrum
- Isolate each hand: play RRRR or LLLL continuously to build finger control independently
- Use a practice pad and a mirror to visually monitor stick heights and motion consistency
- Record and listen back to identify unevenness between d1/d2 and between R/L hands
- Practice with accent patterns to build independence between dynamic control and diddle mechanics

**What to listen for:**
- Both strokes of each diddle at identical volume (evenness within the pair)
- Identical diddle quality from both hands (no dominant-hand bias)
- Perfectly even spacing between all strokes (no flamming, no gaps)
- Clean, focused tone on every stroke with no buzzing
- Smooth, seamless sound at all tempos from open to closed

### Historical Context

The double stroke open roll is one of the oldest and most fundamental rudiments in Western percussion, included in the original NARD (National Association of Rudimental Drummers) 26 rudiments when NARD was founded in 1933. Its lineage traces back to the earliest military drumming traditions in Europe, where the "long roll" (alternating double strokes) was the primary roll technique used for field signals and cadences. Gardiner Strube's 1870 *Drum and Fife Instructor* features the double stroke roll prominently among its 25 lessons.

The distinction between "open" and "closed" in the rudiment's name is significant. "Open" means the individual strokes within each diddle are clearly distinguishable — each note can be heard separately. This contrasts with the multiple bounce (buzz) roll (#4), where the bounces blur together. At faster tempos, the double stroke roll naturally transitions toward a closed sound, but the intent remains that each stroke is controlled and deliberate, not an uncontrolled bounce.

The double stroke open roll holds a unique position in rudimental pedagogy as the foundation for the entire family of counted stroke rolls (#7-15). Every counted roll is simply a defined-length excerpt of the double stroke open roll pattern, terminated with an accent. The five stroke roll is two diddles plus an accent; the seven stroke roll is three diddles plus an accent; and so on up through the seventeen stroke roll. Mastering the continuous double stroke roll makes all counted rolls accessible.

In the marching percussion tradition, the "rudimental roll" or "long roll" refers specifically to the double stroke open roll played continuously, often starting slowly and accelerating. It is considered the defining technique of the rudimental snare drummer and remains a central element of DCI (Drum Corps International) and WGI (Winter Guard International) performance.

The rudiment was retained as PAS #6 when the Percussive Arts Society expanded the list to 40 International Drum Rudiments in 1984 under Jay Wanamaker's committee.
