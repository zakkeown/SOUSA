## 1. Identity

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **PAS Number** | 7 |
| **Name** | Five Stroke Roll |
| **Category** | roll |
| **Family** | counted roll |
| **Composed Of** | 2 diddles + 1 accent -- the shortest odd-count roll and the prototype for all counted stroke rolls |
| **Related** | #6 Double Stroke Open Roll (parent pattern -- continuous diddles), #8 Six Stroke Roll (adds one accent, making it the even-count counterpart), #9 Seven Stroke Roll (extends to 3 diddles + accent), #10-15 longer counted rolls |
| **NARD Original** | Yes (documented as early as 1797) |

## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | sixteenth |
| **Cycle Length** | 1.5 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | 5 |
| **Primary Strokes Per Cycle** | 5 (all are primary; d1, d2, and accent are all full strokes) |

### Stroke Grid

The five stroke roll spans 1.5 beats: two diddle pairs on sixteenth-note subdivisions followed by an accented stroke on the next downbeat or "&."

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | d1 |
| 2 | 1/4 | 1e | R | d2 |
| 3 | 1/2 | 1& | L | d1 |
| 4 | 3/4 | 1a | L | d2 |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | R | A |

When repeated, the second cycle starts on the opposite hand (L) because the odd stroke count naturally alternates the leading hand:

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | L | d1 |
| 2 | 1 + 3/4 | 2a | L | d2 |
| 3 | 2 | 3 | R | d1 |
| 4 | 2 + 1/4 | 3e | R | d2 |
| 5 | 2 + 1/2 | 3& | L | A |

## 3. Sticking & Articulation

### Sticking Sequence

### Stroke Detail Table

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Ornament Role | Parent Stroke | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle, wrist-initiated |
| 2 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle, finger-controlled |
| 3 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle, wrist-initiated |
| 4 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle, finger-controlled |
| 5 | R | accent | none | n/a | Terminal accent, full stroke to define the roll's endpoint |

### Ornament Timing

**Diddle Timing** (identical to #6 Double Stroke Open Roll):
- Each diddle pair occupies one eighth-note duration (1/2 beat)
- Each individual diddle stroke occupies 1/4 beat (one sixteenth note)
- d1 falls on the grid position (downbeat or "&")
- d2 falls on the following sixteenth subdivision ("e" or "a")
- At slow tempos: both strokes are distinct and clearly separated (open)
- At fast tempos: strokes are closely spaced, nearly indistinguishable (closed)

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| accent | 1.0 | Terminal accent at full dynamic level |
| d1 | 0.65 - 0.77 | Tap-level; matches passage dynamic during the diddle body |
| d2 | 0.90 - 0.98 x d1 | Slight natural decay on second bounce (see #6) |

The five stroke roll's dynamic profile is defined by the contrast between the soft, even diddle body and the strong terminal accent. The diddle strokes (d1/d2) sit at tap level, creating a smooth, sustained sound that the accent punctuates. The d2 decay relative to d1 follows the same physics as the double stroke open roll: the second stroke is generated by finger rebound rather than a full wrist throw.

### Accent Pattern

```

```

Single accent on the final (5th) stroke of each cycle.

### Dynamic Contour

The five stroke roll has a two-phase dynamic shape: a flat, low-dynamic body (4 diddle strokes) followed by a single peak (the terminal accent). This "sustained-then-punctuated" contour is the hallmark of all odd-count counted rolls. The diddle body should sound like a brief excerpt of the double stroke open roll at consistent, controlled tap-level dynamics. The accent provides rhythmic definition and acts as a musical arrival point. The contrast ratio between diddle body and accent is the primary expressive parameter -- a wider gap creates a more dramatic effect, while a narrower gap produces a smoother, more legato roll.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 2 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 3 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 4 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 5 | R | accent | full | wrist + arm |

The diddle portion uses the same wrist-finger technique described in #6 Double Stroke Open Roll: d1 is wrist-initiated from half height and d2 is finger-controlled from a lower stick position catching the rebound. The terminal accent is a full stroke from maximum stick height using both wrist and arm, providing the dynamic lift that defines the roll's endpoint. The transition from the last d2 (low, finger-controlled) to the accent (full, arm-driven) requires a rapid lift of the stick -- this "upstroke" from the final diddle to the accent is the primary technical challenge unique to counted rolls.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | **Open doubles.** Both d1 and d2 are played with full wrist strokes at similar heights, clearly audible as separate notes. The accent is a deliberate full stroke with clear preparation. The roll sounds like four distinct taps followed by a loud accent. |
| Moderate (100-140 BPM) | **Transition zone.** d1 via wrist, d2 via fingers catching rebound (alley-oop technique). The diddle body begins to blur into a sustained sound. The accent preparation (upstroke from d2 to accent) becomes the critical coordination point. |
| Fast (140-200 BPM) | **Closed doubles.** Forearms pump, fingers generate d2 from rebound. The diddle body sounds like a brief, smooth roll. The accent must still project clearly above the roll body despite minimal preparation time. Players often use a Moeller whip motion for the accent to maximize power from a compact motion. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Starting hand**: Standard begins RR LL R>; the mirror starts LL RR L>. Both should be practiced equally.
- **Rhythmic placement**: Can begin on any sixteenth-note subdivision (beat, "e," "&," or "a"), changing the accent's rhythmic landing point. Common placements put the accent on a downbeat or on the "&."
- **Triplet interpretation**: At certain tempos, the five stroke roll may be played across a triplet grid rather than sixteenths, yielding a different feel while maintaining the same stroke sequence.
- **Crescendo roll**: Rather than flat dynamics through the diddle body, apply a slight crescendo leading into the accent for a more dramatic arrival.
- **Open-close interpretation**: In orchestral contexts, the diddles may be replaced with buzz strokes for a smoother, sustained roll sound.

### Prerequisites

- #6 Double Stroke Open Roll -- the diddle technique must be solid before adding the start/stop discipline of counted rolls
- #1 Single Stroke Roll -- clean alternation and hand balance

### Builds Toward

- #9 Seven Stroke Roll (extends the diddle body to 3 pairs)
- #10 Nine Stroke Roll (4 diddle pairs)
- #12-15 longer odd-count rolls
- All rudiments requiring controlled roll segments with defined endpoints

### Teaching Notes

The five stroke roll is the gateway rudiment for all counted stroke rolls. It teaches the student to start and stop a roll cleanly with a defined stroke count -- a skill that does not exist in the continuous double stroke open roll (#6).

**Common mistakes:**
- Rushing through the diddle body to reach the accent (uneven spacing between strokes 1-4)
- Playing the accent too softly, failing to differentiate it from the diddle body
- Losing the d2 quality under pressure to prepare for the accent
- Inconsistent stroke count -- accidentally playing 4 or 6 strokes instead of 5
- Uneven diddle quality between the right-hand pair (strokes 1-2) and left-hand pair (strokes 3-4)

**Practice strategies:**
- Begin by playing continuous double stroke rolls (#6), then add an accent every 5th stroke
- Practice at very slow tempos (60 BPM sixteenths) counting "1-e-&-a-2" aloud
- Isolate the transition: play just strokes 4 and 5 (d2 to accent) repeatedly to build the upstroke motion
- Alternate starting hands every repetition to build symmetry
- Use a metronome with the click on the accent to internalize the rhythmic placement

**What to listen for:**
- Even spacing between all 5 strokes
- Clear dynamic contrast between diddle body and accent
- Identical diddle quality from both hands
- Clean accent with no buzzing or double-bounce
- Smooth transition from d2 to accent with no rhythmic hiccup

### Historical Context

The five stroke roll is one of the earliest documented drum rudiments, appearing in military drumming manuals as early as 1797. It was included in the original NARD (National Association of Rudimental Drummers) standard 26 rudiments when NARD was founded in 1933 and retained as PAS #7 in the 1984 expansion to 40 International Drum Rudiments.

As the shortest odd-count roll, the five stroke roll has been a fundamental building block in both military field drumming and orchestral percussion. In military contexts, it served as a brief roll ornament within marching cadences and signals. In orchestral writing, it appears as a short, measured roll in passages requiring precise rhythmic notation rather than an unmeasured tremolo.

The five stroke roll is arguably the most commonly used counted stroke roll in drum set playing, where its 1.5-beat length fits naturally into sixteenth-note fills and phrases. Its compact size makes it versatile for musical application across virtually every genre.
