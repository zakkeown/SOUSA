| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **PAS Number** | 8 |
| **Name** | Six Stroke Roll |

## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | sixteenth |
| **Cycle Length** | 1.5 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | 6 |
| **Primary Strokes Per Cycle** | 6 (all are primary) |

### Stroke Grid

The six stroke roll spans 1.5 beats. Unlike odd-count rolls, it begins and ends with an accent, with the diddle body sandwiched between.

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | A |
| 2 | 1/4 | 1e | L | d1 |
| 3 | 1/2 | 1& | L | d2 |
| 4 | 3/4 | 1a | R | d1 |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | R | d2 |
| 6 | 1 + 1/4 | 2e | L | A |

When repeated, the even stroke count means the leading hand does **not** alternate -- the second cycle also begins with the right hand (in the standard sticking):

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | R | A |
| 2 | 1 + 3/4 | 2a | L | d1 |
| 3 | 2 | 3 | L | d2 |
| 4 | 2 + 1/4 | 3e | R | d1 |
| 5 | 2 + 1/2 | 3& | R | d2 |
| 6 | 2 + 3/4 | 3a | L | A |

**Note on diddle placement**: The two diddle pairs in the six stroke roll are positioned differently from odd-count rolls. Each diddle pair spans the "e-&" or "a-(next beat)" grid slots rather than sitting on the beat. The d1 falls on the offbeat sixteenth and d2 on the following sixteenth, placing the diddles between the two accents.

## 3. Sticking & Articulation

### Sticking Sequence

```
R>  L L  R R  L> | R>  L L  R R  L>
```

### Stroke Detail Table

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Ornament Role | Parent Stroke | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | R | accent | none | n/a | Opening accent, full stroke to initiate the roll |
| 2 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle, wrist-initiated |
| 3 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle, finger-controlled |
| 4 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle, wrist-initiated |
| 5 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle, finger-controlled |
| 6 | L | accent | none | n/a | Closing accent, full stroke to define the roll's endpoint |

### Ornament Timing

**Diddle Timing** (identical to #6 Double Stroke Open Roll and #7 Five Stroke Roll):
- Each diddle pair occupies one eighth-note duration (1/2 beat)
- Each individual diddle stroke occupies 1/4 beat (one sixteenth note)
- d1 falls on the grid position ("e" or "a")
- d2 falls on the following sixteenth subdivision ("&" or downbeat)
- At slow tempos: both strokes are distinct and clearly separated (open)
- At fast tempos: strokes are closely spaced, nearly indistinguishable (closed)

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| accent | 1.0 | Both opening and closing accents at full dynamic level |
| d1 | 0.65 - 0.77 | Tap-level during the diddle body |
| d2 | 0.90 - 0.98 x d1 | Slight natural decay on second bounce (see #6) |

### Accent Pattern

```
>  -  -  -  -  >
```

Two accents per cycle: one on the first stroke and one on the last stroke. This is the defining characteristic that distinguishes even-count rolls from odd-count rolls.

### Dynamic Contour

The six stroke roll has a symmetrical "loud-soft-soft-soft-soft-loud" contour, creating a bookended dynamic shape. The opening accent establishes the roll, the diddle body sustains at tap level, and the closing accent provides resolution. This contrasts with odd-count rolls (like #7) which have a one-sided "soft-to-loud" contour. The symmetrical accent placement gives the six stroke roll a distinct musical character -- it feels more self-contained and resolved than odd-count rolls, which tend to feel directional. The dynamic contrast between accents (1.0) and diddle body (0.65-0.77) should be clear but not exaggerated; the roll should sound like a unified musical gesture, not three disconnected parts.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | accent | full | wrist + arm |
| 2 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 3 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 4 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 5 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 6 | L | accent | full | wrist + arm |

The six stroke roll requires two distinct stroke transitions not found in the five stroke roll: (1) accent-to-diddle (stroke 1 to stroke 2), requiring a rapid downstroke that controls the stick to drop from full height to half height on the opposite hand, and (2) diddle-to-accent (stroke 5 to stroke 6), the same upstroke challenge found in #7. The accent-to-diddle transition is the unique technical challenge of even-count rolls -- after playing a full accent, the player must immediately transition to the soft, controlled diddle body on the other hand.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | **Open doubles.** All strokes individually controlled. Both accents are full arm + wrist strokes. Diddle d1/d2 are separate wrist strokes. The roll sounds like two loud notes framing four soft notes. Plenty of time to prepare each transition. |
| Moderate (100-140 BPM) | **Transition zone.** Diddles use wrist-finger alley-oop technique. The accent-to-diddle transition requires a quick downstroke after the opening accent. The diddle-to-accent transition uses the same upstroke as in #7. |
| Fast (140-200 BPM) | **Closed doubles.** Diddle body is finger-driven from rebound. Both accent transitions must be executed with Moeller whip motions for maximum efficiency. The roll blurs into a smooth accent-roll-accent gesture. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Inverted six stroke roll**: Begin with the diddles and end with accents (LL RR L> R>), sometimes called the "inverted paradiddle-diddle" sticking.
- **Sextuplet interpretation**: Played as a sextuplet (6 notes per beat) rather than across 1.5 beats of sixteenths, giving a triplet-based feel. This is extremely common in drum set applications.
- **Starting hand**: Standard sticking R LL RR L can be mirrored as L RR LL R.
- **Accent relocation**: Moving accents to different positions within the six strokes creates hybrid patterns useful in musical contexts.
- **Double six stroke roll**: Two six stroke rolls played back-to-back (12 strokes across 3 beats) to create longer phrases.

### Prerequisites

- #6 Double Stroke Open Roll -- solid diddle technique
- #7 Five Stroke Roll -- experience with starting and stopping rolls with defined endpoints
- #1 Single Stroke Roll -- clean accent-to-tap transitions

### Builds Toward

- #11 Ten Stroke Roll (extends the even-count accent-diddles-accent structure to 4 diddle pairs)
- Drum set fill vocabulary (the six stroke roll is one of the most commonly applied rudiments on the drum set)

### Teaching Notes

The six stroke roll is unique among counted stroke rolls because of its bookend accent structure. Where odd-count rolls have a single directional accent at the end, the six stroke roll frames its diddle body with accents on both sides.

**Common mistakes:**
- Uneven diddle spacing, particularly rushing through the diddles to reach the closing accent
- Accenting only the final note (treating it like a five stroke roll with an extra stroke)
- Losing the opening accent's clarity when repeating the pattern rapidly
- Playing the two diddle pairs unevenly (the L-hand diddle is often weaker than the R-hand diddle)
- Placing the diddles on incorrect sixteenth-note subdivisions

**Practice strategies:**
- Begin with the accent pattern alone: play R - - - - L at the correct rhythmic spacing, then fill in the diddles
- Practice the accent-to-diddle downstroke transition in isolation
- Play at slow tempos counting "1-e-&-a-2-e" with accents on "1" and "2e"
- Compare with #7 Five Stroke Roll to feel how the opening accent changes the roll's character
- Practice the sextuplet interpretation alongside the sixteenth-note version to build rhythmic flexibility

**What to listen for:**
- Equal dynamic level on both the opening and closing accents
- Even, consistent diddle body between the accents
- Smooth transitions into and out of the diddle body
- Correct rhythmic placement of all six strokes

### Historical Context

The six stroke roll was documented as early as 1817 and was included in the original NARD 26 rudiments. It is one of only two even-count rolls in the PAS 40 (along with the ten stroke roll, #11). Its unique accent-diddles-accent structure has made it one of the most versatile and widely used rudiments in drum set playing, where it is frequently applied to create fills by distributing the accents across toms and cymbals while keeping the diddles on the snare drum.

The six stroke roll's relationship to the paradiddle-diddle (#19) is often noted in pedagogical literature -- the paradiddle-diddle uses the same number of strokes (6) with a singles-then-doubles structure (RLRRLL), while the six stroke roll frames the doubles with accented singles. Some educators describe the six stroke roll as an "inverted paradiddle-diddle" or a "paradiddle-diddle variation hybrid."
