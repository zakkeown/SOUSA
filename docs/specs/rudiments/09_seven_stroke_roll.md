## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | sixteenth |
| **Cycle Length** | 2 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | 7 |
| **Primary Strokes Per Cycle** | 7 (all are primary) |

### Stroke Grid

The seven stroke roll spans 2 beats: three alternating diddle pairs on sixteenth-note subdivisions followed by a terminal accent.

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | d1 |
| 2 | 1/4 | 1e | R | d2 |
| 3 | 1/2 | 1& | L | d1 |
| 4 | 3/4 | 1a | L | d2 |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | R | d1 |
| 6 | 1 + 1/4 | 2e | R | d2 |
| 7 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | L | A |

When repeated, the odd stroke count naturally alternates the leading hand:

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 2 | 3 | L | d1 |
| 2 | 2 + 1/4 | 3e | L | d2 |
| 3 | 2 + 1/2 | 3& | R | d1 |
| 4 | 2 + 3/4 | 3a | R | d2 |
| 5 | 3 | 4 | L | d1 |
| 6 | 3 + 1/4 | 4e | L | d2 |
| 7 | 3 + 1/2 | 4& | R | A |

## 3. Sticking & Articulation

### Sticking Sequence

```
R R  L L  R R  L> | L L  R R  L L  R>
```

### Stroke Detail Table

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Ornament Role | Parent Stroke | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle, wrist-initiated |
| 2 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle, finger-controlled |
| 3 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle, wrist-initiated |
| 4 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle, finger-controlled |
| 5 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle, wrist-initiated |
| 6 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle, finger-controlled |
| 7 | L | accent | none | n/a | Terminal accent, full stroke to define the roll's endpoint |

### Ornament Timing

**Diddle Timing** (identical to #6 and #7):
- Each diddle pair occupies one eighth-note duration (1/2 beat)
- Each individual diddle stroke occupies 1/4 beat (one sixteenth note)
- d1 falls on the downbeat or "&" grid position; d2 falls on the "e" or "a" subdivision
- Open at slow tempos; closed at fast tempos

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| accent | 1.0 | Terminal accent at full dynamic level |
| d1 | 0.65 - 0.77 | Tap-level during the diddle body |
| d2 | 0.90 - 0.98 x d1 | Slight natural decay on second bounce (see #6) |

Identical to #7 Five Stroke Roll. See #7 for detailed discussion of the dynamic relationship between diddle body and terminal accent.

### Accent Pattern

```
-  -  -  -  -  -  >
```

Single accent on the final (7th) stroke.

### Dynamic Contour

Same "sustained-then-punctuated" contour as #7 Five Stroke Roll, but with a longer sustain phase (6 diddle strokes vs. 4). The extended diddle body gives the seven stroke roll a more "rolling" character than the five stroke roll -- there is more time to establish the sustained sound before the accent arrives. This makes the seven stroke roll feel more like a true roll excerpt and less like a quick ornament. See #7 for full discussion of the counted roll dynamic contour.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 2 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 3 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 4 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 5 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 6 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 7 | L | accent | full | wrist + arm |

Identical stroke mechanics to #7 Five Stroke Roll (diddles at half/low with wrist/fingers, terminal accent at full with wrist + arm). The only difference is the additional diddle pair (strokes 5-6) extending the roll body. See #7 for detailed discussion of the d2-to-accent upstroke transition.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | **Open doubles.** Six distinct taps followed by an accent. Each diddle pair clearly audible. Ample time for accent preparation. |
| Moderate (100-140 BPM) | **Transition zone.** Wrist-finger alley-oop for diddles. The longer body (3 diddle pairs) requires sustained relaxation through the roll before the accent upstroke. |
| Fast (140-200 BPM) | **Closed doubles.** Finger-driven diddles from rebound. The extended body creates a smooth, sustained roll sound. Moeller whip for the terminal accent. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Starting hand**: Mirror sticking LL RR LL R> for equal development.
- **Rhythmic placement**: Commonly placed so the accent lands on a downbeat (starting on the "a" of the preceding beat) or on the "&" (starting on the beat).
- **Triplet interpretation**: Can be played across a triplet grid for a different rhythmic feel.
- **Crescendo roll**: Gradual dynamic increase through the body leading to the accent.

### Prerequisites

- #7 Five Stroke Roll -- the shorter odd-count roll must be mastered first
- #6 Double Stroke Open Roll -- sustained diddle quality across 3 pairs

### Builds Toward

- #10 Nine Stroke Roll (extends to 4 diddle pairs + accent)
- #12 Eleven Stroke Roll (5 diddle pairs + accent)
- Longer counted rolls requiring sustained diddle bodies

### Teaching Notes

The seven stroke roll extends the five stroke roll by one diddle pair, introducing the challenge of sustaining even diddle quality across a longer body while still arriving cleanly on the terminal accent.

**Common mistakes:**
- Rushing through the third diddle pair to reach the accent
- Uneven dynamics across the three diddle pairs (typically the middle pair is softest)
- Losing count and playing 5 or 9 strokes instead of 7
- Decelerating through the body as concentration shifts to the upcoming accent

**Practice strategies:**
- Build from #7: play a five stroke roll, then add one more diddle pair before the accent
- Practice counting "1-e-&-a-2-e | 2&" to internalize the 2-beat structure
- Play continuous double stroke rolls (#6) and add an accent every 7th stroke
- Alternate starting hands every repetition

**What to listen for:**
- Even spacing and dynamics across all 6 diddle strokes
- Clean, projected accent clearly differentiated from the body
- Consistent hand-to-hand diddle quality across all 3 pairs

### Historical Context

The seven stroke roll dates to at least 1797 and was included in the original NARD 26 rudiments. It is one of the most commonly notated counted rolls in concert snare drum and orchestral literature, where its 2-beat length aligns naturally with common time signatures. Retained as PAS #9 in the 1984 expansion. See #7 Five Stroke Roll for broader counted roll historical context.
