## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | sixteenth |
| **Cycle Length** | 2.5 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | 9 |
| **Primary Strokes Per Cycle** | 9 (all are primary) |

### Stroke Grid

The nine stroke roll spans 2.5 beats: four alternating diddle pairs on sixteenth-note subdivisions followed by a terminal accent.

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | d1 |
| 2 | 1/4 | 1e | R | d2 |
| 3 | 1/2 | 1& | L | d1 |
| 4 | 3/4 | 1a | L | d2 |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | R | d1 |
| 6 | 1 + 1/4 | 2e | R | d2 |
| 7 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | L | d1 |
| 8 | 1 + 3/4 | 2a | L | d2 |
| 9 | 2 | 3 | R | A |

When repeated, the odd stroke count naturally alternates the leading hand:

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 2 + 1/2 | 3& | L | d1 |
| 2 | 2 + 3/4 | 3a | L | d2 |
| 3 | 3 | 4 | R | d1 |
| 4 | 3 + 1/4 | 4e | R | d2 |
| 5 | 3 + 1/2 | 4& | L | d1 |
| 6 | 3 + 3/4 | 4a | L | d2 |
| 7 | 4 | 1 (next bar) | R | d1 |
| 8 | 4 + 1/4 | 1e | R | d2 |
| 9 | 4 + 1/2 | 1& | L | A |

### Stroke Detail Table

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Ornament Role | Parent Stroke | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 2 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 3 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 4 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 5 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 6 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 7 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 8 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 9 | R | accent | none | n/a | Terminal accent |

### Ornament Timing

**Diddle Timing** (identical to #6, #7, #9):
- Each diddle pair occupies one eighth-note duration (1/2 beat)
- Each individual diddle stroke occupies 1/4 beat (one sixteenth note)
- d1 on the downbeat or "&"; d2 on the "e" or "a"
- Open at slow tempos; closed at fast tempos

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| accent | 1.0 | Terminal accent at full dynamic level |
| d1 | 0.65 - 0.77 | Tap-level during the diddle body |
| d2 | 0.90 - 0.98 x d1 | Slight natural decay on second bounce |

Identical to #7 and #9. See #7 Five Stroke Roll for detailed dynamic discussion.

### Accent Pattern

```
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  >
```

Single accent on the final (9th) stroke.

### Dynamic Contour

Same "sustained-then-punctuated" contour as all odd-count rolls. With 8 diddle strokes in the body (the longest body so far in the odd-count series), the nine stroke roll has a pronounced rolling quality. The extended sustain phase makes the terminal accent feel like a strong resolution after a substantial roll. The challenge is maintaining perfectly even dynamics across all 4 diddle pairs without drift or fatigue-induced decay.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 2 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 3 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 4 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 5 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 6 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 7 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 8 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 9 | R | accent | full | wrist + arm |

Same stroke mechanics as #7 and #9 (see #7 for detailed physical description). The extended body requires sustained relaxation and endurance through 4 diddle pairs before executing the accent upstroke.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | **Open doubles.** Eight distinct taps followed by an accent. Each pair clearly separated. The long body demands concentration to maintain even spacing. |
| Moderate (100-140 BPM) | **Transition zone.** Wrist-finger alley-oop. The 2-beat body requires sustained relaxation. Fatigue may emerge in the later diddle pairs. |
| Fast (140-200 BPM) | **Closed doubles.** Finger-driven rebound creates a smooth, sustained roll. The 4-pair body now sounds like a genuine measured roll excerpt. Moeller whip for the terminal accent. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Starting hand**: Mirror sticking LL RR LL RR L> for equal development.
- **Rhythmic placement**: The 2.5-beat cycle creates interesting syncopation when repeated -- the accent lands alternately on the beat and on the "&."
- **Triplet interpretation**: Can span triplet groupings for a different rhythmic context.
- **Crescendo roll**: Gradual dynamic build through the 8-stroke body into the accent.

### Prerequisites

- #9 Seven Stroke Roll -- must be able to sustain 3 diddle pairs evenly
- #7 Five Stroke Roll -- fundamental counted roll skill
- #6 Double Stroke Open Roll -- sustained diddle endurance

### Builds Toward

- #12 Eleven Stroke Roll (5 diddle pairs + accent)
- #13 Thirteen Stroke Roll (6 diddle pairs + accent)
- Longer odd-count rolls requiring extended diddle bodies

### Teaching Notes

The nine stroke roll is the first counted roll where the diddle body is long enough to feel like a genuine roll rather than a quick ornament. This makes it a key transition point in counted roll pedagogy.

**Common mistakes:**
- Dynamic drift through the 4 diddle pairs (usually getting softer toward the end)
- Rushing to the accent, compressing the final diddle pair
- Losing track of the stroke count in the extended body
- Uneven quality between R and L diddle pairs across 4 repetitions

**Practice strategies:**
- Build from #9: play a seven stroke roll, then add one more diddle pair before the accent
- Practice counting "1-e-&-a-2-e-&-a | 3" to internalize the 2.5-beat structure
- Use a metronome with subdivisions to check internal spacing
- Focus on maintaining consistent d1/d2 dynamics through all 4 pairs

**What to listen for:**
- Even dynamics and spacing across all 8 diddle strokes (no drift or fatigue)
- Clean terminal accent clearly above the roll body
- Consistent diddle quality from first pair to last pair

### Historical Context

The nine stroke roll dates to at least 1797 and was included in the original NARD 26 rudiments. It is frequently encountered in concert snare drum literature and march compositions, where its 2.5-beat length provides a substantial roll that fits within common phrase structures. Retained as PAS #10 in the 1984 expansion.
