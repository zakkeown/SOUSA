## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | sixteenth |
| **Cycle Length** | 2.5 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | 10 |
| **Primary Strokes Per Cycle** | 10 (all are primary) |

### Stroke Grid

The ten stroke roll spans 2.5 beats. Like the six stroke roll (#8), it begins and ends with an accent, with the diddle body sandwiched between. It extends the six stroke roll's structure from 2 diddle pairs to 4.

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | A |
| 2 | 1/4 | 1e | L | d1 |
| 3 | 1/2 | 1& | L | d2 |
| 4 | 3/4 | 1a | R | d1 |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | R | d2 |
| 6 | 1 + 1/4 | 2e | L | d1 |
| 7 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | L | d2 |
| 8 | 1 + 3/4 | 2a | R | d1 |
| 9 | 2 | 3 | R | d2 |
| 10 | 2 + 1/4 | 3e | L | A |

When repeated, the even stroke count means the leading hand does **not** alternate -- the second cycle also begins with the right hand (in the standard sticking):

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 2 + 1/2 | 3& | R | A |
| 2 | 2 + 3/4 | 3a | L | d1 |
| 3 | 3 | 4 | L | d2 |
| 4 | 3 + 1/4 | 4e | R | d1 |
| 5 | 3 + 1/2 | 4& | R | d2 |
| 6 | 3 + 3/4 | 4a | L | d1 |
| 7 | 4 | 1 (next bar) | L | d2 |
| 8 | 4 + 1/4 | 1e | R | d1 |
| 9 | 4 + 1/2 | 1& | R | d2 |
| 10 | 4 + 3/4 | 1a | L | A |

## 3. Sticking & Articulation

### Sticking Sequence

```
R>  L L  R R  L L  R R  L> | R>  L L  R R  L L  R R  L>
```

### Stroke Detail Table

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Ornament Role | Parent Stroke | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | R | accent | none | n/a | Opening accent, full stroke |
| 2 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 3 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 4 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 5 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 6 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 7 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 8 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 9 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 10 | L | accent | none | n/a | Closing accent, full stroke |

### Ornament Timing

**Diddle Timing** (identical to #6, #7, #8):
- Each diddle pair occupies one eighth-note duration (1/2 beat)
- Each individual diddle stroke occupies 1/4 beat (one sixteenth note)
- Open at slow tempos; closed at fast tempos

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| accent | 1.0 | Both opening and closing accents at full dynamic level |
| d1 | 0.65 - 0.77 | Tap-level during the diddle body |
| d2 | 0.90 - 0.98 x d1 | Slight natural decay on second bounce |

Identical to #8 Six Stroke Roll. See #8 for discussion of the bookend-accent dynamic profile.

### Accent Pattern

```
>  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  >
```

Two accents per cycle: one on the first stroke and one on the last stroke. Same bookend structure as #8 Six Stroke Roll.

### Dynamic Contour

Same symmetrical "loud-soft-...-soft-loud" contour as #8 Six Stroke Roll, but with a significantly longer sustain phase (8 diddle strokes vs. 4). The extended diddle body gives the ten stroke roll a more substantial rolling character between the accents. At faster tempos, it sounds like a measured roll passage framed by two accents. The challenge is maintaining perfectly even dynamics across all 4 diddle pairs without drift. See #8 for full discussion of the even-count roll contour.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | accent | full | wrist + arm |
| 2 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 3 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 4 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 5 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 6 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 7 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 8 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 9 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 10 | L | accent | full | wrist + arm |

Same two-transition stroke mechanics as #8 Six Stroke Roll (accent-to-diddle downstroke and diddle-to-accent upstroke), with the added challenge of sustaining the diddle body through 4 pairs rather than 2. See #8 for detailed physical description of the even-count roll transitions.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | **Open doubles.** Two accents framing eight distinct taps. All strokes individually controlled. The extended body requires sustained concentration. |
| Moderate (100-140 BPM) | **Transition zone.** Wrist-finger alley-oop for diddles. The long body (4 pairs) may introduce fatigue. Both accent transitions use the same mechanics as #8. |
| Fast (140-200 BPM) | **Closed doubles.** Finger-driven diddles with a smooth, sustained roll between the two accents. The 4-pair body sounds like a genuine measured roll. Moeller whip for both accents. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Starting hand**: Mirror sticking L> RR LL RR LL R> for equal development.
- **Placement variations**: The opening accent can land on the beat, "&", or any subdivision, changing the closing accent's rhythmic position.
- **Both accents at the end**: An alternative interpretation places both accented singles at the end of the roll (RR LL RR LL R L) rather than bookending. This is less common in the PAS standard but appears in some literature.
- **Both accents at the beginning**: Another variant (R L LL RR LL RR), also less common.
- **Crescendo through body**: Building dynamics through the diddle body toward the closing accent.

### Prerequisites

- #8 Six Stroke Roll -- the shorter even-count roll with the same accent-diddles-accent structure
- #10 Nine Stroke Roll -- sustained diddle quality across 4 pairs
- #6 Double Stroke Open Roll -- diddle endurance

### Builds Toward

- Extended musical phrases combining even-count rolls with odd-count rolls
- Concert and marching literature requiring measured rolls of specific durations

### Teaching Notes

The ten stroke roll combines the bookend accent structure of #8 Six Stroke Roll with the extended body length of #10 Nine Stroke Roll. It is the longer of the two even-count rolls in the PAS 40 and presents the challenge of maintaining even diddle quality across a substantial body while executing clean accent transitions at both ends.

**Common mistakes:**
- All mistakes from #8 Six Stroke Roll (see #8), amplified by the longer body
- Dynamic drift through the 4 diddle pairs
- Losing count in the extended body (playing 8 or 12 strokes instead of 10)
- Uneven accent dynamics -- the closing accent is often louder than the opening accent, or vice versa

**Practice strategies:**
- Build from #8: play a six stroke roll, then extend the diddle body by two more pairs
- Count "1-e-&-a-2-e-&-a-3-e" to internalize the 2.5-beat structure
- Practice the opening accent-to-diddle transition in isolation
- Ensure both accents are at identical dynamic levels

**What to listen for:**
- Equal dynamic level on both opening and closing accents
- Even dynamics and spacing across all 8 diddle strokes
- Smooth transitions into and out of the diddle body at both ends
- Correct stroke count (10, not 8, 9, 11, or 12)

### Historical Context

The ten stroke roll is documented as early as 1779, making it one of the oldest recorded drum rudiments. It was included in the original NARD 26 rudiments. Along with the six stroke roll (#8), it is one of only two even-count rolls in the PAS 40, distinguished by its bookend accent structure (accent-diddles-accent) rather than the diddles-then-accent structure of odd-count rolls. Retained as PAS #11 in the 1984 expansion.
