## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | sixteenth |
| **Cycle Length** | 3 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | 11 |
| **Primary Strokes Per Cycle** | 11 (all are primary) |

### Stroke Grid

The eleven stroke roll spans 3 beats: five alternating diddle pairs on sixteenth-note subdivisions followed by a terminal accent.

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | d1 |
| 2 | 1/4 | 1e | R | d2 |
| 3 | 1/2 | 1& | L | d1 |
| 4 | 3/4 | 1a | L | d2 |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | R | d1 |
| 6 | 1 + 1/4 | 2e | R | d2 |
| 7 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | L | d1 |
| 8 | 1 + 3/4 | 2a | L | d2 |
| 9 | 2 | 3 | R | d1 |
| 10 | 2 + 1/4 | 3e | R | d2 |
| 11 | 2 + 1/2 | 3& | L | A |

When repeated, the odd stroke count naturally alternates the leading hand:

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 3 | 4 | L | d1 |
| 2 | 3 + 1/4 | 4e | L | d2 |
| 3 | 3 + 1/2 | 4& | R | d1 |
| 4 | ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 11 | 5 + 1/2 | 2& (bar 2) | R | A |

## 3. Sticking & Articulation

### Sticking Sequence

R R  L L  R R  L L  R R  L> | L L  R R  L L  R R  L L  R>
```

### Stroke Detail Table

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Ornament Role | Parent Stroke | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 2 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 3 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 4 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 5 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 6 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 7 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 8 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 9 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 10 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 11 | L | accent | none | n/a | Terminal accent |

### Ornament Timing

**Diddle Timing** (identical to all previous counted rolls; see #7):
- Each diddle pair occupies one eighth-note duration (1/2 beat)
- Each individual diddle stroke occupies 1/4 beat (one sixteenth note)
- Open at slow tempos; closed at fast tempos

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| accent | 1.0 | Terminal accent at full dynamic level |
| d1 | 0.65 - 0.77 | Tap-level during the diddle body |
| d2 | 0.90 - 0.98 x d1 | Slight natural decay on second bounce |

Identical to all odd-count rolls. See #7 Five Stroke Roll for detailed dynamic discussion.

### Accent Pattern

```
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  >
```

Single accent on the final (11th) stroke.

### Dynamic Contour

Same "sustained-then-punctuated" contour as all odd-count rolls, with a 10-stroke diddle body -- the longest body encountered so far in the odd-count series. The extended sustain phase produces a substantial roll sound that closely approximates the continuous double stroke open roll (#6), with the terminal accent providing the defined endpoint. Maintaining perfectly even dynamics across 5 diddle pairs becomes the central challenge. See #7 for full contour discussion.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 2 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 3 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 4 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 5 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 6 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 7 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 8 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 9 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 10 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 11 | L | accent | full | wrist + arm |

Same stroke mechanics as all odd-count rolls (see #7). The 5-pair body requires endurance and sustained relaxation. At faster tempos, fatigue becomes a significant factor in the later diddle pairs.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | **Open doubles.** Ten distinct taps followed by an accent. The 3-beat body is long enough to require concentration on maintaining even spacing and dynamics throughout. |
| Moderate (100-140 BPM) | **Transition zone.** Wrist-finger alley-oop. Fatigue may become noticeable in the 4th and 5th diddle pairs. Maintaining relaxation is critical. |
| Fast (140-200 BPM) | **Closed doubles.** The 5-pair body sounds like a genuine measured roll. Finger-driven rebound technique is essential for endurance through the extended body. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Starting hand**: Mirror sticking LL RR LL RR LL R> for equal development.
- **Rhythmic placement**: The 3-beat cycle aligns evenly with 3/4 time and the first three beats of 4/4.
- **Crescendo roll**: Gradual dynamic build through the extended body into the accent.

### Prerequisites

- #10 Nine Stroke Roll -- sustained diddle quality across 4 pairs
- #7 Five Stroke Roll -- fundamental counted roll skill
- #6 Double Stroke Open Roll -- endurance across extended diddle passages

### Builds Toward

- #13 Thirteen Stroke Roll (6 diddle pairs + accent)
- #14 Fifteen Stroke Roll (7 diddle pairs + accent)
- Extended roll passages in concert and marching literature

### Teaching Notes

The eleven stroke roll marks the transition point where counted rolls begin to feel like genuine roll passages rather than quick ornaments. Its 3-beat length means the diddle body occupies a musically significant duration.

**Common mistakes:**
- Dynamic drift (getting softer or louder through the 5 diddle pairs)
- Fatigue-induced unevenness in the later pairs (pairs 4 and 5)
- Losing the stroke count -- 11 is commonly confused with 9 or 13
- Rushing through the body to reach the accent

**Practice strategies:**
- Build incrementally: master #10 Nine Stroke Roll, then add one more diddle pair
- Count "1-e-&-a-2-e-&-a-3-e | 3&" to internalize the 3-beat structure
- Practice the continuous double stroke open roll (#6) for endurance, then add accents every 11th stroke
- Focus on the 4th and 5th diddle pairs where fatigue typically emerges

**What to listen for:**
- Even dynamics and spacing across all 10 diddle strokes
- No fatigue-induced decay in the later diddle pairs
- Clean terminal accent clearly above the body
- Correct stroke count (11)

### Historical Context

The eleven stroke roll is documented as early as 1804 and was included in the original NARD 26 rudiments. Its 3-beat length makes it particularly useful in concert literature where measured rolls of specific durations are required. Retained as PAS #12 in the 1984 expansion.
