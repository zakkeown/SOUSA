## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | sixteenth |
| **Cycle Length** | 3.5 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | 13 |

### Stroke Grid

The thirteen stroke roll spans 3.5 beats: six alternating diddle pairs on sixteenth-note subdivisions followed by a terminal accent.

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | d1 |
| 2 | 1/4 | 1e | R | d2 |
| 3 | 1/2 | 1& | L | d1 |
| 4 | 3/4 | 1a | L | d2 |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | R | d1 |
| 6 | 1 + 1/4 | 2e | R | d2 |
| 7 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | L | d1 |
| 8 | 1 + 3/4 | 2a | L | d2 |
| 9 | 2 | 3 | R | d1 |
| 10 | 2 + 1/4 | 3e | R | d2 |
| 11 | 2 + 1/2 | 3& | L | d1 |
| 12 | 2 + 3/4 | 3a | L | d2 |
| 13 | 3 | 4 | R | A |

When repeated, the odd stroke count naturally alternates the leading hand.

### Stroke Detail Table

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Ornament Role | Parent Stroke | Notes |
|---|------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 2 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 3 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 4 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 5 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 6 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 7 | L | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 8 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 9 | R | d1 | none | n/a | First stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 10 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle |

| 12 | L | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of left-hand diddle |
| 13 | R | accent | none | n/a | Terminal accent |

### Ornament Timing

**Diddle Timing** (identical to all previous counted rolls; see #7):
- Each diddle pair occupies one eighth-note duration (1/2 beat)
- Each individual diddle stroke occupies 1/4 beat (one sixteenth note)
- Open at slow tempos; closed at fast tempos

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| accent | 1.0 | Terminal accent at full dynamic level |
| d1 | 0.65 - 0.77 | Tap-level during the diddle body |
| d2 | 0.90 - 0.98 x d1 | Slight natural decay on second bounce |

Identical to all odd-count rolls. See #7 Five Stroke Roll for detailed dynamic discussion.

### Accent Pattern

```
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  >
```

Single accent on the final (13th) stroke.

### Dynamic Contour

Same "sustained-then-punctuated" contour as all odd-count rolls. The 12-stroke diddle body (6 pairs) is long enough that the roll closely resembles a continuous double stroke open roll with a defined endpoint. The primary expressive challenge shifts from "defining the roll" to "sustaining even quality over a long passage." See #7 for full contour discussion.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 2 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 3 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 4 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 5 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 6 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 7 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 8 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 9 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 10 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 11 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 12 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 13 | R | accent | full | wrist + arm |

Same stroke mechanics as all odd-count rolls (see #7). The 6-pair body demands sustained endurance and relaxation. Fatigue management becomes the primary physical concern at this length.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | **Open doubles.** Twelve distinct taps followed by an accent. The 3.5-beat body requires significant concentration to count accurately and maintain even dynamics. |
| Moderate (100-140 BPM) | **Transition zone.** Wrist-finger alley-oop. Fatigue is a real concern across 6 pairs. Breath control and arm relaxation become important. |
| Fast (140-200 BPM) | **Closed doubles.** The 6-pair body sounds like a sustained measured roll. Efficient finger-driven rebound technique is essential to avoid fatigue. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Starting hand**: Mirror sticking for equal development.
- **Rhythmic placement**: The 3.5-beat cycle creates syncopation when repeated in 4/4 -- accent lands alternately on the beat and the "&."
- **Crescendo roll**: Gradual dynamic build through the 12-stroke body, arriving at the accent as the dynamic peak.

### Prerequisites

- #12 Eleven Stroke Roll -- sustained quality across 5 diddle pairs
- #10 Nine Stroke Roll -- intermediate-length odd-count roll
- #6 Double Stroke Open Roll -- diddle endurance

### Builds Toward

- #14 Fifteen Stroke Roll (7 diddle pairs + accent)
- #15 Seventeen Stroke Roll (8 diddle pairs + accent)
- Extended measured roll passages in concert literature

### Teaching Notes

The thirteen stroke roll is the point in the counted roll series where the body is long enough to feel like a true sustained roll rather than a measured figure. Counting accuracy and endurance become paramount.

**Common mistakes:**
- Losing the stroke count -- 13 strokes is commonly confused with 11 or 15
- Fatigue-induced unevenness in the later diddle pairs (pairs 5 and 6)
- Gradual tempo drift (acceleration or deceleration) through the long body
- Dynamic drift across 6 diddle pairs

**Practice strategies:**
- Build incrementally from #12 Eleven Stroke Roll by adding one more diddle pair
- Count beats aloud ("1-e-&-a-2-e-&-a-3-e-&-a | 4") to track position within the roll
- Practice the continuous double stroke open roll (#6) for endurance, inserting accents every 13th stroke
- Use the metronome to check for tempo drift through the body

**What to listen for:**
- Even dynamics and spacing across all 12 diddle strokes
- No tempo drift or fatigue-induced decay
- Clean terminal accent clearly above the body
- Correct stroke count (13)

### Historical Context

The thirteen stroke roll is documented as early as 1862 and was included in the original NARD 26 rudiments. In concert and orchestral snare drum literature, it provides a roll lasting nearly a full bar of 4/4 time, making it useful for composers specifying measured rolls of precise duration. Retained as PAS #13 in the 1984 expansion.
