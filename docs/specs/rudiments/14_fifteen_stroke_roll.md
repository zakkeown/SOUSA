## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | sixteenth |
| **Cycle Length** | 4 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | 15 |
| **Primary Strokes Per Cycle** | 15 (all are primary) |

### Stroke Grid

The fifteen stroke roll spans exactly 4 beats (one full bar of 4/4): seven alternating diddle pairs on sixteenth-note subdivisions followed by a terminal accent.

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | d1 |
| 2 | 1/4 | 1e | R | d2 |
| 3 | 1/2 | 1& | L | d1 |
| 4 | 3/4 | 1a | L | d2 |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | R | d1 |
| 6 | 1 + 1/4 | 2e | R | d2 |
| 7 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | L | d1 |
| 8 | 1 + 3/4 | 2a | L | d2 |
| 9 | 2 | 3 | R | d1 |
| 10 | 2 + 1/4 | 3e | R | d2 |
| 11 | 2 + 1/2 | 3& | L | d1 |
| 12 | 2 + 3/4 | 3a | L | d2 |
| 13 | 3 | 4 | R | d1 |
| 14 | 3 + 1/4 | 4e | R | d2 |
| 15 | 3 + 1/2 | 4& | L | A |

When repeated, the odd stroke count naturally alternates the leading hand.

| 14 | R | d2 | none | n/a | Second stroke of right-hand diddle |
| 15 | L | accent | none | n/a | Terminal accent |

### Ornament Timing

**Diddle Timing** (identical to all previous counted rolls; see #7):
- Each diddle pair occupies one eighth-note duration (1/2 beat)
- Each individual diddle stroke occupies 1/4 beat (one sixteenth note)
- Open at slow tempos; closed at fast tempos

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| accent | 1.0 | Terminal accent at full dynamic level |
| d1 | 0.65 - 0.77 | Tap-level during the diddle body |
| d2 | 0.90 - 0.98 x d1 | Slight natural decay on second bounce |

Identical to all odd-count rolls. See #7 Five Stroke Roll for detailed dynamic discussion.

### Accent Pattern

```
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  >
```

Single accent on the final (15th) stroke.

### Dynamic Contour

Same "sustained-then-punctuated" contour as all odd-count rolls. The 14-stroke diddle body (7 pairs) spanning nearly a full bar of 4/4 means this roll is functionally a measured whole-note roll with a defined accent endpoint. The body is long enough that it is essentially indistinguishable from a continuous double stroke open roll excerpt. See #7 for full contour discussion.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 2 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 3 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 4 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 5 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 6 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 7 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 8 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 9 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 10 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 11 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 12 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 13 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 14 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 15 | L | accent | full | wrist + arm |

Same stroke mechanics as all odd-count rolls (see #7). The 7-pair body requires significant endurance. Efficient technique and relaxation are essential to avoid fatigue-induced deterioration across the extended body.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | **Open doubles.** Fourteen distinct taps followed by an accent. At 60 BPM, the body spans 3.5 seconds -- a significant duration requiring both physical endurance and mental counting discipline. |
| Moderate (100-140 BPM) | **Transition zone.** Wrist-finger alley-oop. The 7-pair body demands sustained relaxation. Fatigue management and breath control are important for maintaining quality through the final pairs. |
| Fast (140-200 BPM) | **Closed doubles.** The extended body sounds like a full, sustained measured roll. Efficient rebound-based technique is mandatory at this length. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Starting hand**: Mirror sticking for equal development.
- **Rhythmic placement**: At 4 beats, the cycle aligns perfectly with one bar of 4/4, making it the natural "one-bar roll" in common time.
- **Crescendo roll**: A natural application -- crescendo through the 14-stroke body to arrive at the accent as the dynamic climax.
- **Decrescendo entry**: Start the accent loud, then diminish through the body for a "fading roll" effect.

### Prerequisites

- #13 Thirteen Stroke Roll -- sustained quality across 6 diddle pairs
- #12 Eleven Stroke Roll -- endurance at 5 diddle pairs
- #6 Double Stroke Open Roll -- long-form diddle endurance

### Builds Toward

- #15 Seventeen Stroke Roll (8 diddle pairs + accent -- the longest counted roll)
- Extended measured roll passages spanning multiple bars

### Teaching Notes

The fifteen stroke roll is the standard "one-bar roll" in 4/4 time. Its 4-beat length makes it one of the most practically useful long counted rolls in concert and marching literature.

**Common mistakes:**
- All endurance-related issues from shorter rolls, amplified by the 7-pair body
- Losing count -- 15 strokes is commonly confused with 13 or 17
- Gradual tempo drift across the 4-beat body
- Fatigue-induced decay in the final pairs (pairs 6 and 7)

**Practice strategies:**
- Build incrementally from #13 Thirteen Stroke Roll
- Think of the roll as "one full bar of sixteenth-note diddles plus an accent"
- Count beats aloud throughout: "1-e-&-a-2-e-&-a-3-e-&-a-4-e | 4&"
- Practice in the context of music -- play 3 bars of time, then one bar of fifteen stroke roll
- Train the continuous double stroke open roll (#6) for endurance, then section off 15-stroke excerpts

**What to listen for:**
- Even dynamics and spacing across all 14 diddle strokes
- No tempo drift or fatigue-induced decay through the 4-beat body
- Clean terminal accent on the "&" of beat 4
- Correct stroke count (15)

### Historical Context

The fifteen stroke roll is documented as early as 1810 and was included in the original NARD 26 rudiments. As the natural one-bar roll in 4/4 time, it is one of the most frequently encountered counted rolls in orchestral and concert snare drum literature. Composers who write a whole-note with a roll sign in 4/4 are implicitly requesting a fifteen stroke roll (7 diddle pairs filling the bar, accenting the downbeat of the next bar). Retained as PAS #14 in the 1984 expansion.
