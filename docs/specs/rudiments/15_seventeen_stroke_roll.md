## 2. Rhythmic Structure

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Time Signature** | 4/4 |
| **Base Subdivision** | sixteenth |
| **Cycle Length** | 4.5 beats |
| **Strokes Per Cycle** | 17 |
| **Primary Strokes Per Cycle** | 17 (all are primary) |

### Stroke Grid

The seventeen stroke roll spans 4.5 beats: eight alternating diddle pairs on sixteenth-note subdivisions followed by a terminal accent. This exceeds one bar of 4/4, making it the only standard counted roll that crosses a barline in common time.

| # | Position (beats) | Grid Slot | Hand | Type |
|---|------------------|-----------|------|------|
| 1 | 0 | 1 | R | d1 |
| 2 | 1/4 | 1e | R | d2 |
| 3 | 1/2 | 1& | L | d1 |
| 4 | 3/4 | 1a | L | d2 |
| 5 | 1 | 2 | R | d1 |
| 6 | 1 + 1/4 | 2e | R | d2 |
| 7 | 1 + 1/2 | 2& | L | d1 |
| 8 | 1 + 3/4 | 2a | L | d2 |
| 9 | 2 | 3 | R | d1 |
| 10 | 2 + 1/4 | 3e | R | d2 |
| 11 | 2 + 1/2 | 3& | L | d1 |
| 12 | 2 + 3/4 | 3a | L | d2 |
| 13 | 3 | 4 | R | d1 |
| 14 | 3 + 1/4 | 4e | R | d2 |
| 15 | 3 + 1/2 | 4& | L | d1 |
| 16 | 3 + 3/4 | 4a | L | d2 |
| 17 | 4 | 1 (next bar) | R | A |

When repeated, the odd stroke count naturally alternates the leading hand.

### Ornament Timing

**Diddle Timing** (identical to all previous counted rolls; see #7):
- Each diddle pair occupies one eighth-note duration (1/2 beat)
- Each individual diddle stroke occupies 1/4 beat (one sixteenth note)
- Open at slow tempos; closed at fast tempos

## 4. Dynamics Model

### Velocity Ratios

| Stroke Type | Velocity Ratio | Notes |
|-------------|---------------|-------|
| accent | 1.0 | Terminal accent at full dynamic level |
| d1 | 0.65 - 0.77 | Tap-level during the diddle body |
| d2 | 0.90 - 0.98 x d1 | Slight natural decay on second bounce |

Identical to all odd-count rolls. See #7 Five Stroke Roll for detailed dynamic discussion.

### Accent Pattern

```
-  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  >
```

Single accent on the final (17th) stroke.

### Dynamic Contour

Same "sustained-then-punctuated" contour as all odd-count rolls. The 16-stroke diddle body (8 pairs) spanning a full bar plus one beat makes this the longest sustained roll in the counted roll family. At this length, the roll is functionally equivalent to a measured long roll excerpt from #6 with a defined accent ending. The primary challenge is pure endurance -- maintaining perfectly even dynamics and spacing across 8 diddle pairs without any drift or deterioration. See #7 for full contour discussion.

## 5. Physical / Kinesthetic

### Stroke Map

| # | Hand | Stroke Type | Height Class | Motion Type |
|---|------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 2 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 3 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 4 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 5 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 6 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 7 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 8 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 9 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 10 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 11 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 12 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 13 | R | d1 | half | wrist |
| 14 | R | d2 | low | fingers |
| 15 | L | d1 | half | wrist |
| 16 | L | d2 | low | fingers |
| 17 | R | accent | full | wrist + arm |

Same stroke mechanics as all odd-count rolls (see #7). The 8-pair body is the most physically demanding counted roll. Efficient rebound technique and relaxation are absolutely essential -- any tension accumulates over 16 strokes and produces audible deterioration.

### Tempo-Dependent Behavior

| Tempo Range | Technique Changes |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Slow (60-100 BPM) | **Open doubles.** Sixteen distinct taps followed by an accent. At 60 BPM, the body spans 4 seconds -- a very long duration requiring exceptional physical endurance and mental counting discipline. Breath control and arm relaxation are critical. |
| Moderate (100-140 BPM) | **Transition zone.** Wrist-finger alley-oop. The 8-pair body is the ultimate endurance test for the wrist-finger technique. Any inefficiency in the diddle motion will produce audible fatigue by pairs 6-8. |
| Fast (140-200 BPM) | **Closed doubles.** The extended body sounds like a full, sustained long roll. Purely rebound-based technique is the only physically sustainable approach at this length and tempo. |

## 6. Variations & Pedagogy

### Common Variations

- **Starting hand**: Mirror sticking for equal development.
- **Rhythmic placement**: At 4.5 beats, the cycle crosses the barline in 4/4, with the accent landing on the downbeat of the next bar -- a natural phrasing for full-bar rolls resolving to the next measure.
- **Crescendo roll**: The long body is ideal for crescendo application, building from pianissimo to the fortissimo accent.
- **Tied-note roll**: In notation, often written as a dotted whole note with a roll sign, resolving to the next downbeat.

### Prerequisites

- #14 Fifteen Stroke Roll -- sustained quality across 7 diddle pairs
- #13 Thirteen Stroke Roll -- endurance at 6 diddle pairs
- #6 Double Stroke Open Roll -- long-form diddle endurance at maximum capacity

### Builds Toward

- Extended measured roll passages exceeding one bar
- The continuous double stroke open roll (#6) at any length -- the seventeen stroke roll is the final step before unlimited-length rolling

### Teaching Notes

The seventeen stroke roll is the capstone of the counted roll series. It was the only counted roll added to the PAS list in 1984 that was not in the original NARD 26, reflecting its status as the natural extension of the counted roll progression to its practical upper limit.

**Common mistakes:**
- Fatigue-induced deterioration in the later diddle pairs (pairs 6, 7, and 8)
- Tempo drift (almost always acceleration) across the 4+ beat body
- Losing count -- 17 is easily confused with 15
- Tension buildup through the arms and hands, killing rebound quality

**Practice strategies:**
- Build incrementally from #14 Fifteen Stroke Roll -- add one more diddle pair
- Think of the roll as "one full bar of sixteenth-note diddles, plus one more pair, plus accent on the next downbeat"
- Count beats aloud throughout: "1-e-&-a-2-e-&-a-3-e-&-a-4-e-&-a | 1"
- Practice with a metronome set to quarter notes to check for tempo drift
- Train the continuous double stroke open roll (#6) for endurance -- if you can play #6 comfortably for 8+ bars, the seventeen stroke roll will be achievable
- Focus on physical relaxation: consciously release tension in the forearms between each diddle pair

**What to listen for:**
- Even dynamics and spacing across all 16 diddle strokes with no fatigue-induced decay
- No tempo drift (acceleration or deceleration) through the 4.5-beat body
- Clean terminal accent on the downbeat of the next bar
- Correct stroke count (17)
- Smooth, sustained roll quality throughout the entire body

### Historical Context

The seventeen stroke roll was first documented around 1931 and was **not** included in the original NARD 26 rudiments. It was added by the Percussive Arts Society in 1984 as part of the expansion from 26 to 40 International Drum Rudiments, under Jay Wanamaker's committee. It is the only counted stroke roll that was a PAS addition rather than a NARD original.

The seventeen stroke roll represents the practical upper limit of counted stroke rolls. Beyond 17 strokes, rolls are typically notated as unmeasured tremolos or long rolls of indefinite duration. Its 4.5-beat length crosses the barline in 4/4 time, making it the natural choice for rolls that span a full bar and resolve on the following downbeat -- a common phrasing in both concert and marching percussion literature.
